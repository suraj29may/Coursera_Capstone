# IBM Data Science Professional Certificate Projects

This repository contains my capstone project for the *IBM Data Science Professional Certificate* on Coursera. 
The program consists of 9 online courses that will provide you with the **latest job-ready tools and skills**, including open source tools and libraries, Python, databases, SQL, data visualization, data analysis, statistical analysis, predictive modeling, and machine learning algorithms. Youâ€™ll learn data science through hands-on practice in the IBM Cloud using real data science tools and real-world data sets.

Upon successfully completing these courses, you will have built a portfolio of data science projects to provide you with the confidence to plunge into an exciting profession in data science.

In addition to earning a Professional Certificate from Coursera, you'll also receive a **digital badge from IBM** recognizing your proficiency in data science.

### Their are 9 courses in this professional certificate. Which are as follows:
1. What is Data Science?
2. Tools for Data Science
3. Data Science Methodology
4. Python for Data Science and AI
5. Databases and SQL for Data Science
6. Data Analysis with Python
7. Data Visualization with Python
8. Machine Learning with Python
9. Applied Data Science Capstone

This repository have my capstone project that I submitted as a part of IBM Data Science Professional certificate.

The last course, *Applied Data Science Capstone*, has multiple submissions. These include:
1. A basic introduction to the capstone project notebook for week 1 of the course
2. An assignment notebook for week 3 of the course
3. A PDF document highlighting the introduction and data collection for the final project for week 4 of the course
4. The final project notebook, project report, and project presentation for week 5 of the course
